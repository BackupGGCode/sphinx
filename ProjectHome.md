## What is Sphinx? ##

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was originally created to translate the new Python documentation, but has now been cleaned up in the hope that it will be useful to many other projects.
